Hey, I'm Filippo, an SRE at [Miro](https://miro.com/), part of their Cloud and Infrastructure org. I'm currently based in Amsterdam, after a three-year stint in Milan.

My background is in biomedical engineering, but I found myself genuinely drawn to the challenges within platforms, systems, and infrastructure. That passion directly led me to dive into the k8s landscape, craft automation with Terraform, and focus on ensuring our systems can scale effectively.

I'm always keen on learning and enjoy tackling interesting problems. Recently, I've been exploring the AI space by looking into research from major tech companies and universities, and experimenting with vibey coding tools.

Outside of tech, I'm a huge üèÄ fan, especially the NBA (yes, I've probably watched too many late-night games).

Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filippomoret/) if you'd like to chat.
