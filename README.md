# My Personal Blog

This is the source code for my personal blog, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. It is automatically deployed using GitHub Pages.

## Theme

This blog uses the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for Hugo, with some minor customisations.

You can view the live blog at [filippomoret.me](https://filippomoret.me).
